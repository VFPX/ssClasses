# ssClasses


Project Manager: [Jun Tangunan](mailto:ss.classes.jun@gmail.com)

This is a collection of some of my classes I created and is being used by me and some VFP developers. This is not the complete library though yet because I still have to transfer ssButton and ssTitleBar from my old sandstorm36 library to this one. In the meantime, you can start enjoying ssClasses library.

## What is in this library

* ssAnchorSizer: while Anchor property allows us to resize objects inside our form, anchor leaves behind the insides of a grid, listbox and combobox on its original sizes. This class will fix that.

* ssButton3: The first ssButton is done inside my old sandstorm36 library. And then I decided to transfer that to ssClasses library so it became ssButton2. Then I created this one so it became ssButton3. However, I removed ssButton2 in the meantime because that is still dependent on **sssupport.app** for the images which I plan to completely remove later.

* ssButton4: ssButton3 and 4 are almost the same. These are patterned after a button in MSO2007 where the button is curved and is being highlighted on mouse enter. The main difference between 3 & 4 is that 3 starts with gray while 4 already starts with the color you have set albeit a lighter tone. On mouse enter, color becomes a little bit darker.

* ssClose: Originally ssClose3. I now removed both ssClose and ssClose2 and renamed ssClose3 to ssClose. A small close button that can be positioned on any of the four corners of your form.
